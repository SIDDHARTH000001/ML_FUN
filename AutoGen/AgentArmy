ðŸ§  This repository showcases a dynamic agent creation system using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. It features a "creator" agent that programmatically spawns N specialized agents based on task requirements and orchestrates their collaboration to achieve complex objectives.

Each generated agent can be tailored with distinct roles, tools, and language model configurations, enabling scalable and modular task execution. This approach exemplifies AutoGen's capability to build adaptive, multi-agent workflows that can be extended or customized for various applications.
