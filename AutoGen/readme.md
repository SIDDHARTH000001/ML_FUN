ðŸ“š This repository offers foundational examples of creating AI agents using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. It demonstrates how to define, configure, and run agents capable of autonomous or collaborative tasks.

The examples showcase interactions between AssistantAgent and UserProxyAgent, illustrating how agents can communicate, execute code, and incorporate human feedback. 
By leveraging AutoGen's capabilities, developers can build sophisticated multi-agent workflows that integrate large language models (LLMs), external tools, and human-in-the-loop mechanisms.


These examples serve as a starting point for exploring AutoGen's potential in developing intelligent, conversational agents and complex AI systems.
