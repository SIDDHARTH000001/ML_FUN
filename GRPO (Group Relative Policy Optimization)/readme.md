# GRPO Training Experiments

This repo contains two simple notebooks demonstrating **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**:

- `grpo_unsloth.ipynb` → GRPO training using **Unsloth** for efficient fine-tuning.  
- `grpo_gist.ipynb` → GRPO training based on the minimal [willccbb gist](https://gist.github.com/willccbb/4676755236bb08cab5f4e54a0475d6fb).

Both notebooks fine-tune small LLMs on reasoning-style tasks (e.g., GSM8K).  
Use them to compare Unsloth’s optimized training vs. a minimal GRPO implementation.
