🧠 MCP Server Examples – Local Practice
This project contains three basic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementations to explore how models can interact with external tools via MCP.

📟 command_line_server: Executes shell commands.

➗ math_server: Evaluates basic math expressions.

☁️ weather_server: Returns mock weather data.

These are lightweight examples built for local experimentation with MCP tool interfaces.
